Welcome to the **Restaurant Ordering System** repository! This project aims to streamline the process of ordering food in a hotel or restaurant through a web-based interface, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors.

#### Project Overview

The **Restaurant Ordering System** provides an end-to-end solution for managing food orders in a hospitality environment. Customers can conveniently scan a QR code placed on their table to access the digital menu, place orders directly from their devices, and even pay their bills online. Here's a detailed breakdown of the system's functionality:

#### Working  
Customers can scan our QR placed on the table. It will redirect to a website where customers can see the hotel's food menu. Customers will give orders through a website to the hotel. The chef can see the order of the customer on display. After the food is ready, the waiter will serve it to the customer. Customers can re-order also. In the end, customers can see their bills on the website and pay from there. It will save time in taking orders and there will be no mischief on the hotel bill.
